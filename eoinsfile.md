# Hello Group 6 :-) 

So this is an example markdown file which I created as per the steps 0-9 in README.md. I request you to do the same.

In the mean time, here is an example of some of the cool things you can do in a markdown file:

### Unordered Lists
- Item a
- Item b
- Item c
- Item d

### Ordered Lists
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
4. Item 4
5. Item 5

### Images
